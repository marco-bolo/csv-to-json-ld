In task 2.2, these objectives were met by exploration and comparison of databases, software and bioinformatic pipelines, aiming to facilitate the implementation of eDNA-based monitoring. Under this task, we reviewed the literature and here provide a comprehensive overview of widely used primer sets for eDNA metabarcoding, pipelines run for different marker genes, and reference databases used to assign taxonomy. Next, we conducted a comparison of bioinformatic pipelines for two types of metabarcoding data (18S and 12S), inviting people around the world to contribute results from running their respective pipelines on the same dataset(s).",,mbo_org_mbo_wp2,,,
